# 🚀 AutoPush GitHub from VS Code – *My Original Automation Workflow*

> 🧠 Built from scratch, not copied from YouTube or guided by a tutorial.  
> Just me, a problem I faced, and a solution I created.

## 💡 What’s This All About?

This project is all about automating your Git workflow — adding, committing, and pushing files to GitHub — directly from **your local machine**, using **a custom Python script**.

📌 No GitLab.  
📌 No GitHub Actions.  
📌 No third-party CI/CD tools.  

Just pure logic and command-line power, wired together into one neat script.

## 🤔 Why I Built This

I work on a lot of code, especially solved problems and personal projects.  
But pushing changes manually every time? It started feeling repetitive and unnecessary.

So I thought:
> *"Why not automate the whole process myself?"*

And that’s exactly what I did.

✅ Built using only tools I already use (Git + Python + VS Code)  
✅ No external automation needed  
✅ One-click or time-based auto-push system  
✅ Fully in my control

## 📦 What’s Inside the Repo

Here’s how this project is structured:

| File / Folder             | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `auto_push_script.py`    | The main script that does all the Git magic automatically |
| `setup_instructions.md`  | Step-by-step guide to help you set everything up easily |
| `commands_used.txt`      | A list of Git/terminal commands I used during setup |
| `logs/`                  | Contains `log.txt` — real-time activity logs from the script |
| `screenshots/`           | Visual proof that the system works (add your own screenshots here) |

---

## 🔧 Features

- Detects any file changes in your repo
- Automatically adds, commits (with timestamp), and pushes to GitHub
- Logs every action with a proper timestamp in `log.txt`
- Handles errors, timeouts, and failed Git commands
- Can be scheduled using Windows Task Scheduler

---

## 🎯 Who Should Use This?

- Developers tired of pushing manually
- Beginners wanting to learn how Git works behind the scenes
- Anyone who loves clean, local automation
- People working on daily/weekly codebases that need constant backup

---

## 🛠 Tools I Used

- 🧪 **Python 3.x** – for the automation script  
- 🔧 **Git CLI** – to run Git commands programmatically  
- 💻 **Visual Studio Code** – my daily development environment  
- 🕒 **Windows Task Scheduler** – to automate when the script runs

---

## 🛠 How to Set It Up

I’ve explained the entire process in [`setup_instructions.md`](./setup_instructions.md).  
It covers:

- How to clone your repo
- How to install Git (if not already installed)
- How to plug in and customize the Python script
- How to automate it with Task Scheduler

You don’t need to be an expert — just follow the steps!

---

## 🧪 Live Proof & Logs

- 📸 Screenshots are inside the `screenshots/` folder
- 📜 Logs for every Git operation are saved in `logs/log.txt` (you’ll see actual timestamps and messages)

I’ll keep updating these as I keep improving and using the system.

---

## ✅ Current Status

- 🔄 **Working perfectly** — tested on multiple projects
- 🧠 **100% original** — built from my own thought process
- 🔧 **Maintainable** — clean, customizable, and built for real use

---

## 🔮 What’s Next?

- Email or SMS notifications after every push
- Retry mechanism if push fails due to network
- A simple UI so that even non-tech folks can use it

## 🙋‍♂️ Who Made This?

Hey! I’m **Haricharhan** 👋  
I love building tools that solve real-world coding annoyances.

This project came from a simple question I asked myself:
> *"Can I automate my GitHub workflow... without using anything beyond what I already know?"*

Turns out — I could. And now, so can you.

---

## 🤝 Want to Contribute?

This was made from personal need, but I’d love to see others try it, improve it, or even just use it.  
If you find it helpful:

- Star ⭐ the repo
- Fork it
- Try it out and share your version
- Just give credit, that’s all I ask :)

## 🌟 That’s It!

Thanks for checking this out!  
Whether you use it, build on it, or just learn something — I hope this project inspires you to think differently about everyday dev tasks.

Let’s keep building awesome things!
