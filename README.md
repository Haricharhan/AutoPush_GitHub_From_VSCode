# AutoPush_GitHub_From_VSCode

This project automates Git operations — add, commit, and push — directly from your local machine (VS Code) to GitHub, using a custom Python script. No third-party CI/CD tools (like GitLab or GitHub Actions) are used. 

# 🚀 AutoPush GitHub from VS Code – *My Unique Automation Workflow*

> This is not a copied idea – it's my original concept, implemented from scratch.

## 💡 Project Idea

Have you ever wanted to push your project from VS Code to GitHub **automatically** without depending on GitLab, fancy CI/CD tools, or external plugins?

I did too. That's why I built this simple yet powerful automation system — to auto-push changes from my VS Code workspace to GitHub, fully controlled by **my own logic and commands**.

## 🔧 What This Project Shows

This repo will walk you through:
- 📥 Setting up Git in VS Code
- ⚙️ Configuring your GitHub repo for automation
- 🧠 Writing your own logic for auto-push (based on triggers or schedules)
- 🧪 My real-time test logs, working setup, and observations

---

## 🔍 Why This Is Special

> 🤖 **This isn't a YouTube-copy project.**  
> I developed it from a *real problem* I faced while pushing my solved coding problems.

### Highlights:
- No external tools like GitLab, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions used.
- 100% local and customized Git command automation.
- Trigger-based push strategy (e.g., time-based or save-based auto push).
- Designed, tested, and documented by **me** — *Haricharhan*.

## 📁 Project Structure (What You'll Find Inside)

- `setup_instructions.md` – Step-by-step guide to replicate this on your machine
- `auto_push_script.py` – My original logic to trigger Git commands
- `logs/` – Real-time logs to show it's working
- `screenshots/` – Proof of working implementation
- `commands_used.txt` – All terminal commands I used

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Ideal for coders who want to **automate their commit-push routine**
- Helps beginners understand **how Git works under the hood**
- Great way to learn VS Code, GitHub CLI, and basic automation

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- VS Code
- Git CLI
- Python (optional for scripting)
- Windows Scheduler / Task Scheduler (for periodic execution)

---

## 📢 Future Scope

I plan to:
- Add optional email/SMS notifications after every push
- Integrate basic error logging and retry logic
- Build a GUI version for non-tech users

## 🧍 About Me

I'm **Haricharhan**, and I built this project as a solution to a real workflow bottleneck.  
It wasn’t inspired by YouTube or copied from a tutorial — it’s mine from the ground up.
